### Analysis and evaluation of Airbnb operations in New York
*This is a project I did with my team where I analyzed and evaluated Airbnb operations in New York.*

- **Goal**: To evaluate Airbnb listing performance across NYC neighborhoods.
- **Description**: Analyzed AB_NYC_2019 dataset with 48,896 records. Cleaned data, explored listing distribution, room types, prices, availability, and reviews. Used maps and charts to visualize trends and identify high-demand areas.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PowerBI.
- **Results**: Found Manhattan and Brooklyn had highest demand and lowest vacancy. Entire home/apt listings were most expensive; private rooms were most booked. Suggested investment focus on high-demand zones.
