### BITCOIN Price Analysis and Predictive Model Building
*This project was completed collaboratively with a teammate, where we delved into Bitcoin's mechanics and developed a model to predict its price, highlighting its significance in financial analysis*

- **Goal**: Understanding Bitcoin and the importance of Price Prediction.
- **Description**: Learn what Bitcoin is, why it has become an investment option during this period, the risks and opportunities it presents to investors, the reasons behind failures in Bitcoin investment due to a lack of knowledge, and how to avoid those risks. We selected a dataset containing Bitcoin price fluctuations from 2018 to 2024, consisting of 12 columns and 2,441 rows, using the "open time" (opening price) column as the basis for analysis. We used charts to illustrate the upward and downward trends of Bitcoin prices and to clearly observe its fluctuations over time. Then, we incorporated an additional dataset on gold price fluctuations during the same period to compare its trends with those of Bitcoin. Finally, based on historical data, we attempted to build a model to forecast short-term future prices, intended as a reference for investors to consider.
- **Technology**: ARIMA, Time series, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Logistic Regression
- **Results**: If you're aiming for high profits and are willing to accept high risks, then investing in Bitcoin might be suitable for a long-term investment project. If you prefer a safer and more stable investment, consider investing in gold. Bitcoin price predictions are for reference only; in reality, the factors influencing Bitcoin's value are highly diverse, and its extreme volatility makes investing in this asset class particularly risky. Be a smart investorâ€”do thorough research before putting money into any investment channel, especially the cryptocurrency market.
