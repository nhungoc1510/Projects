### Issue and solutions related to room cancellations
*This is a project I did personally where I figured out the issue and brought solutions related to room cancellations.*

- **Goal**: Understand the reasons for customer cancellations and predict future room cancellation trends.
- **Description**: Analyzed hotel_booking dataset with 119,390 records. Divided 36 columns into 3 main groups for analysis purposes: Customer, booking procedure and service segment. Cleaning data by removing null, duplicates, and hiding unnecessary columns. Used charts to visualize and find solutions.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, PowerBI.
- **Results**: Hotels can effectively predict trends and understand cancellation reasons using booking data. To enhance online customer acquisition, they should also gather more guest feedback and online reviews, and actively engage with guests to encourage positive comments.
